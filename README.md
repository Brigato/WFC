This is a coding challenge copy from TheCodingTrain where I try and insert comments to understand this function in more detail

(Coding Challenge 171: Wave Function Collapse)[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rI_y2GAlQFM]

I am simply making a copy of the code, trying to fix the bugs in the earlier versions from the future versions.

I will tag the commits based on the versions from the video.
